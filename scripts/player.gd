## ============================================================================
## PLAYER - Main player character controller
## ============================================================================
##
## WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
## This script controls the player character. It handles:
## - Movement (arrow keys/WASD)
## - Health and damage
## - Experience points and leveling up
## - Stat upgrades when leveling
## - Death
##
## This script works with:
## - scenes/player.tscn (the player scene)
## - scripts/ui/hud.gd (displays health/XP bars)
## - scripts/ui/level_up_ui.gd (shows upgrade choices)
## - scripts/weapon_system.gd (automatic shooting)
##
## ============================================================================
## COMMON MODIFICATIONS (REQUIRES CODE CHANGES):
## ============================================================================
##
## Change player speed:
##   - Find: @export var move_speed: float = 200.0
##   - Change the number to make player faster/slower
##
## Change starting health:
##   - Find: @export var max_health: float = 100.0
##   - Change the value
##
## Change XP requirements:
##   - Find: func calculate_xp_for_next_level()
##   - Modify the formula
##
## Add new upgrade types:
##   - See stat_upgrade_resource.gd for instructions
##   - Add upgrade_STAT functions (like upgrade_health)
